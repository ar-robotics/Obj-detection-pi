# Object_Detection_mobilenet

This works if you have opencv installed, tflite_runtime and Flask( if you want to stream it by snapshot to the VR). Detailed explanation on requirements will come later. The code uses COCO dataset and some pre-trained models like mobilenet and efficientnet to detect objects from the dataset.
